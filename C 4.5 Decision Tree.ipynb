    "##### C4.5 is an algorithm developed by Ross Quinlan used to generate the decision tree. It is an extension of Quinlan's earlier ID3 algorithm. C4.5 builds decision trees from a set of training data the same way as ID3, using the concept of information entropy, which is the measurement of the uncertainty in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### At each node of the tree, C4.5 chooses the data attributes that have the most effective split. The splitting criterion is nothing but the normalized information gain (difference in entropy). Then the attribute with the highest normalized information gain leveraged to make the decision. The C4.5 algorithm then recurs on the smaller sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In addition to that, tree pruning reduces the depth of the tree, and Information gain measures the difference in entropy. The threshold is the calculated average of the sum of the positive and negative class values for the feature, which has the highest information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Finally, the cut-off value 0.2 has the lowest error rate of 0.206910 with training data, and test data has an error rate of 0.273914. it also appeared that the Decision Tree performs well with such (adult-census-income) dataset, which may be because of the binary nature of the data, where the prediction is either '1' or '0'."
